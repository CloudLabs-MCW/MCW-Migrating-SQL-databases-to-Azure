## Exercise 1: Perform database assessments

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you use the Azure Data Studio to perform assessments on the `WideWorldImporters` database. You create two assessments: one for SQL DB and a second for SQL MI. These assessments provide reports about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure managed SQL database service options.

> Azure Data Studio helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. Azure Data Studio recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.


### Task 1: Connect to the WideWorldImporters database on the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you perform some configuration for the `WideWorldImporters` database on the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance to prepare it for migration.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

1. Select the **<inject key="Resource Group Name" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group from the list.

   ![Resource groups is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and the "hands-on-lab resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups1.png "Resource groups list")

1. In the list of resources for your resource group, select the **<inject key="SQLVM Name" enableCopy="false"/>** VM.

### Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

In this task, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the `WideWorldImporters` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

1. In Azure Data Studio click on **Azure SQL migration** and click on **+ New migration**

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/Ex1-Task2-S1.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In **Step 1: Database for assessment**, select **widewordimplantation**, click on **Next**. 

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/Ex1-Task2-S2.png "New DMA project")

3. In **Step 2: Assessment result and recommendation**, select **Azure SQL Database (PREVIEW)** from chose your Azure SQL target and scroll down, and scroll down till end click on **view/select**. 

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/Ex1-Task2-S3.png "New project settings")

4. Select **WideWorldImporters** under database, review the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL DB, and Click on the **Cancel** button.

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/Ex1-Task2-S4.png "New project settings")

    > The DMA assessment for migrating the `WideWorldImporters` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB reveals features in use that are not supported. These features, including Service broker, prevent WWI from migrating to the Azure SQL DB PaaS offering without making changes to their database.

### Task 3: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Managed Instance

With one PaaS offering ruled out due to feature parity, perform a second DMA assessment against Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the SQL MI service.

1. In Azure Data Studio click on **Azure SQL migration** and click on **+ New migration**

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/Ex1-Task2-S1.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In **Step 1: Database for assessment**, select **widewordimplantation**, click on **Next**. 

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/Ex1-Task2-S2.png "New DMA project")

3. In **Step 2: Assessment result and recommendation**, select **Azure SQL Database Managed Instance** from chose your Azure SQL target and scroll down, and scroll down till end click on **view/select**. 

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/Ex1-Task3-S3.png "New project settings")

4. Select **WideWorldImporters** under database, review the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL DB, and Click on the **Cancel** button.

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/Ex1-Task3-S4.png "New project settings")

10. The database, including the Service Broker feature, can be migrated as is, providing an opportunity for WWI to have a fully managed PaaS database running in Azure. Previously, their only option for migrating a database using features incompatible with Azure SQL Database, such as Service Broker, was to deploy the database to a virtual machine running in Azure (IaaS) or modify the database and associated applications to remove the use of the unsupported features. The introduction of Azure SQL MI, however, provides the ability to migrate databases into a managed Azure SQL database service with _near 100% compatibility_, including the features that prevented them from using Azure SQL Database.
