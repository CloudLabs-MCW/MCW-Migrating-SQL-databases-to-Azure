# Secure SQL with Microsoft defender

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a proof of concept (PoC) for migrating an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database to Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). You will conduct assessments to identify any feature parity or compatibility issues between the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database and Azure's managed database offerings. Next, you will migrate the customer's on-premises gamer information web application and database to Azure with minimal downtime. Finally, you will enable advanced SQL MI features to enhance the security and performance of the customer's application.

## Objective

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you will follow a structured architecture that begins with provisioning an Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI) for migrating an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database. The process starts by performing a database assessment to identify compatibility issues, followed by an online data migration using the Azure Data Migration Service (DMS). You will then configure a secure virtual network, deploy the customerâ€™s web application to Azure, and integrate it with the managed instance. The lab concludes with enabling advanced SQL MI features for optimizing performance and security, offering a complete solution for migrating and modernizing SQL Server workloads in Azure.

## Explanation of Components

- Azure Portal:  Centralized web interface for managing Azure resources. It allows users to provision services like SQL Managed Instances, configure networks, monitor performance, and troubleshoot issues. With its intuitive platform, users can easily manage and adjust settings for cloud resources, making it essential for efficient Azure operations.

- Visual Studio 2019: Visual Studio 2019 is used to deploy and publish the customer's web application to Azure. It supports continuous development and integration practices, enabling developers to push updates to the cloud-hosted web app that interacts with SQL MI.

## Getting Started with the Lab
Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the bottom of the Lab guide to switch to different exercises of the lab guide.

## Accessing Your Lab Environment
Once you're ready to dive in, your virtual machine and lab guide will be right at your fingertips within your web browser.
